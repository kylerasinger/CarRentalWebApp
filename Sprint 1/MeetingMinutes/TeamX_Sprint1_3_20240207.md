### Discussing Programming Tools
* We will create a CRUD application in Node JS that all the team members will be able to access through GitHub. 
* Tailwind CSS will be used for the frontend of the website: its FREE ready-to-use components will be of use to use for our webpage: simple and efficient.
### Working Ethics:
* Never work on the main branch of the project. Each one of us will download the project on his local machine and work on it.
* Each one of us will create his own branch and code one it and once the code is approved by other members, then make push (or commit) to main branch and wait for this request to be accepted by the owner of the main branch.
### Discuss Frontend
* Login Page: A title, 3 CSS Flexboxes for the three types of users. Once the user chooses the right option, he will be prompted to login and if the credentials are correct, he will be allowed access. 
* If the user is an admin, once his normal credentials are verified, he will be redirected to an admin page where he will enter his admin credentials.
