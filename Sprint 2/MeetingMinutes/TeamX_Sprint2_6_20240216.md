* Activity log was in the Wiki page instead of being in the Sprint 1 folder.
* It turned out that we needed to create a folder into which we put the Meeting Minutes and the Readme file.  
### Sprint 2 To Do
* Acceptance test : on tasks, label it as AT, add label to issue et if it passes , implement.
* Implement all features during Sprint 2
* Main goal during Sprint 2: 
* Create LCD pipeline : include unit test for every push/pull request to main branch
* Cloning API Repo from GitHu: no problem if not from previous student, but adapt it to our project's features 
### Assigned Tasks
