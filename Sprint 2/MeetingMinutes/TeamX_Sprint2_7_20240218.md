### Discussing Progress of Members 
* Viktor: Starting to design the frontend. Researching optimal home page for a car rental website. 
* Kyle: Added google and GitHub login options. Implemented session states and login to the header. Installed the adapter between MongoDB and nextauth.js. Installed typescript module and moved the users database to car-rental users. Added files so structure is clearer, began playing with MongoDB to learn how to query and implement permission-based pages. 
* Khaled: Researching how to use Node Js with MongoDB for backend.
* Thomas: Working for displaying the cars.
* Ahmed: No new task going on right now, still learning how backend works and programming languages/tools. Waiting until next lecture to ask advice from the professor.
* Omar: From my end nothing much but I’ll work on some front end (removing stuff we don’t want from the home bar panel).
### Discussing Blockings
* We cannot develop our frontend because we don’t know our database scheme for the backend .
### To Do in Next Session:
* Discuss how to develop frontend in parallel with backend.
