### Discuss How Frontend and Backend Work
* We have 1 local host in client directory and 1 in backend direction (API).
* When doing npm run dev, we open the frontend local host. When opening backend and writing npm start in its directory, backend is hosted at local host 3001. This way, both local hosts are separated. 
* In Mongodb database: Postman is a testing tool. If I want to add brand, it must follow scheme in brand.js. In getRequest, you get Json data. Connection from frontend to backend through https requests. 

### To Do in Next Session:
* Plan for Sprint 2 Submission 
* Ask TA for feedback on work achieved so far
